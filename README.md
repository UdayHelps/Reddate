## What it is

- **Watch together.** Start a room from your TV, share a code or a QR, and everyone's player stays in step. A host controls playback; guests choose their own subtitles.
- **A TV app that feels native.** Home with Top 10 rows per streaming service, Continue watching, big posters, a remote-friendly layout and a stream picker that shows speed and device support before you press play.
- **You bring the sources.** Reddate speaks the Stremio addon format, so the catalogs and stream sources you already use work. Reddate hosts no video.

## Features

**Watch parties**
- Rooms start only when you invite someone, so watching alone creates nothing on the server.
- One shared "anchor" position. Every player steers itself toward it, so a slow connection catches up without dragging the room back.
- Hosts (more than one is possible) play, pause and seek. A host who drops out has a short grace period before control passes to a guest.
- Chat with pop-ups over the video on TV, and a voice and video lounge on phones and computers.

**Home and discovery**
- Top 10 per service (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Apple TV+, Max and more), trending, popular, genres and search.
- Profiles, one per person, each with its own Home rows, addons, Continue watching and tracking.
- A calendar of upcoming releases and watch tracking with Trakt and Simkl.

**Streams and subtitles**
- Streams are ranked before you choose: speed measured on your connection, quality, audio languages, and whether your TV, phone or computer can play them.
- Subtitles in any language, per viewer, with delay, size, colour and position.

**Addons**
- Any Stremio-compatible addon (catalogs, streams, subtitles).
- **Reddate Catalog**: movies and series from TMDB, with your country and rows chosen on the [addons page](https://tv.reddate.xyz/addon-list).
- **Reddate YT**: YouTube trending, music, gaming, news, search and channels, with your own free YouTube API key. It plays in Reddate's own player, with the room tools one press away.

**Privacy**
- Rooms live in memory and disappear when everyone leaves. Chat is relayed, never stored or logged. See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) for exactly what is and isn't private.
